# LeadCapture-Automation

## Overview
LeadCapture-Automation is a fully automated workflow built using [Make.com](https://www.make.com) to streamline client lead capture and management. It receives new client data via webhook, stores the data in Google Sheets, and sends email notifications and welcome emails to both the team and new clients. This system reduces manual effort and increases operational efficiency.

## Features
- **Webhook Integration:** Automatically receive client data from external sources.
- **Google Sheets Storage:** Structured and easily accessible data storage.
- **Email Notifications:** Instant alerts to the team on new leads.
- **Welcome Emails:** Personalized emails sent automatically to new clients.
- **Customizable Workflow:** Easily adaptable for different business needs.

## How It Works
1. Client data is sent to the Make.com webhook URL.
2. The webhook triggers the scenario to record the data into Google Sheets.
3. Email notifications are sent to the team alerting them of the new lead.
4. A welcome email is sent to the client to confirm receipt.
